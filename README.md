# Server Bootstrapper

## Overview

You probably won't get in trouble using this. This is a custom server JAR meant to apply patches to Spigot JARs that require the `-no-verify` JVM option. This is not against most free hosting's TOS because you do not bring your own software; it's still Spigot or whatever they intended you to use, but with `-no-verify`. You did not crypto mine or anything, and it does not abuse their service, such as DDOSing. You should be fine. But if not, I am not responsible.

## Usage

Check in Releases for the newest release. I will probably not update this, but if you need a new feature that is **NOT AGAINST FREE HOSTING GENERAL TOS**, I will not make a RAM hacker or anything. If you need a SlimeWorld one, I am still making that.

## Releases
